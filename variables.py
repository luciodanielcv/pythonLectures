#Variables exercise

a = input("a? ")
b = input("b? ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a = " + a)
print("b = " + b)

#Variable naming
#Underscore as best practice for naming variables
#A variable name could be 'input' although there is a function
#with the same name. Python will not comply!
#This is a bad practice! Although Python does not comply
#it is difficult to read code such like this!
